EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

The objective of this exercise is to conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a selected dataset using libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, or seaborn. This involves understanding the data's structure, types, and key metrics, examining the distribution of individual variables, identifying correlations between variables, and detecting outliers. Visualization tools such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps will be used to illustrate the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and any anomalies, ultimately providing valuable insights into the dataset.

KEY ACTIVITIES
- Data Loading and Initial Inspection
- Data Cleaning
- Summary Statistics
- Distribution Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Outlier Detection
- Data Visualization(Heatmaps, Scatter plots etc)
- Insights and Interpretation
